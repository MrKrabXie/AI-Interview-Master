### 项目名称：

**AI Interview Master (面试宝典)**

### 项目描述：

**Interview Master** is a comprehensive interview preparation tool that leverages web scraping, NLP-based similarity detection, and dynamic content generation to provide personalized interview questions and answers. It is designed for both job seekers and employers, offering a robust learning platform with interactive features such as a ranking system, difficulty grading, and real-time feedback. The app includes a rewarding mechanism, enabling users to earn points through asking and answering questions, which can be used to unlock advanced features or redeem rewards.

The core functionality includes:
1. **Web Scraping**: Collecting interview questions from various platforms (like Boss, LeetCode, and Zhihu).
2. **Question Similarity Detection**: Ensuring unique questions through NLP-based similarity calculations.
3. **Grading and Ranking**: Assigning difficulty and scores to questions for prioritizing high-quality content.
4. **Answer Generation**: Generating answers using pre-defined templates, incorporating user feedback for continuous learning.
5. **Reward System**: Introducing a points-based system for user engagement—earning points by asking/answering questions and interacting with the platform.
6. **User Feedback Loop**: Feedback collected from users is used to retrain and optimize the answer generation models.

### 技术栈 (Tech Stack):

- **Frontend**: React Native / Flutter (Cross-platform mobile application)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- **Web Scraping**: Scrapy, Requests
- **NLP**: spaCy, TF-IDF, BERT
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Text-to-Speech**: gTTS, FFmpeg
- **Reinforcement Learning**: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **API**: RESTful API with Flask or FastAPI
- **Task Queue**: Celery (for background scraping tasks)

### 项目亮点 (Highlights):

1. **Web Scraping & Similarity Detection**: Scrapes interview questions from various platforms and performs NLP-based similarity checks to ensure that only unique questions are added to the database.
2. **Difficulty Grading & Scoring System**: Automatically grades questions based on difficulty and quality, ensuring that users focus on high-priority content.
3. **Answer Templates & Feedback Mechanism**: Generates answers based on predefined templates for various types of questions (e.g., algorithm, system design) and refines the answers based on user feedback.
4. **Interactive Q&A & Reward System**: Users can earn points for asking and answering questions, which can be redeemed for unlocking advanced content or features.
5. **User-Centric Learning**: Provides personalized learning experiences through continuous feedback, allowing for adaptive learning based on the user’s progress and feedback.
6. **Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Improvement**: Implements reinforcement learning to improve answer quality and model accuracy based on user interactions and feedback.

### 更新内容 (Updates):

- **v1.0**: Initial release with basic scraping, question storage, and answer generation features.
- **v1.1**: Added similarity detection and filtering to prevent redundant questions from entering the database. Implemented difficulty grading and scoring system.
- **v1.2**: Introduced feedback mechanism for continuous model improvement and personalized learning experiences. Added a points-based reward system.
- **v1.3**: Enhanced reinforcement learning for adaptive model training based on user feedback. Expanded question types and added API endpoints for easier integration.
